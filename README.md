# AdventOfCode2023
##### This repo is just to keep track of my personal progress in <i>AOC 2023</i>.
##### To run the codes, save the input files in local machine and change the path directory within code as needed.
##### To avoid modifying the code, you just need to save the input file as "input.txt" within the same directory as your .py file 
##### HAPPY LEARNING :>
